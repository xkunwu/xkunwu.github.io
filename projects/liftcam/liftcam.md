# Abnormal detection

## Environment

This project focus on monitoring video cameras within the lift.

### What counts for “abnormal”?

There are several cases that counted as dangerous or against general regulations:

- E-Bike: may cause hazard situations either within the lift of the building, especially fire.
- Animal: eg. dogs without leash.

There are also cases that may imply hazard:

- Fall down: especially elder people.
