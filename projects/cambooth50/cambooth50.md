# Camera Booth
> DSLR camera array based human body reconstruction.

This is an engineering project aiming at 3D human body reconstruction through [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry).

Most of the (dirty) works are done by Deshan Gong, when he was a master student at Uni Bath.
I co-supervised his master study final project with [Mac Yang](http://www.yongliangyang.net/) during the summer of 2018, then wrapped up into his final dissertation.
