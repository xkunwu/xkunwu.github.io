## Why use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)?
Markdown is much easier to write - people can concatenate on the content, rather than the messy format tags.
Besides, GitHub is great for code sharing and project management.

Achknowledgement: I am using [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
