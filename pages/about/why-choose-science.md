Oenology is the science and study of wine and winemaking - this was what I chose for my undergraduate study.
[College of Oenology at Northwest A&F University](http://wine.nwsuaf.edu.cn/) is no doubt the best choice of this study in China - this was where I spent 4 memorable years.

I like practical and experimental studies, so I enjoyed learning many courses through experiments about the nature there (e.g. Microbiology, Organic Chemistry, Plant Science, Genetics, Viticulture, etc.)
I also like the broad scope and many specialized topics that my college can offer, which include interesting studies like Wine-making, Wine-tasting, French language, etc.

But, why didn't I choose wine related career after graduate?

Well, people with proper professional training about wine-making know the following facts:
-   The quality of wine mostly depends on the quality of grapes, which further depends on many factors that cannot be change: breed of the grape, geographic location, climate of the year, etc.
-   The other major factor that can effect quality in wine is how those grapes are made into wine: only master winemakers know the secret of preserving the best flavors of the grapes.

This kind of fact that "some grapes are born to be great" or "some wine are made to be great" sounds very pessimistic to me.
So I decided to change my career direction, in which my creativeness and efforts can lead to meaningful achievements.
