# Why didn't I choose wine related career?

Oenology is the science and study of wine and wine-making (actually we study how to make all types of alcoholic drinks) - this was what I chose for my undergraduate study.
[College of Oenology at Northwest A&F University](http://wine.nwsuaf.edu.cn/) is no doubt the best choice of this study in China - this was where I spent 4 memorable years.

## My college rocks
I like practical and experimental studies, so I enjoyed learning courses through experiments about nature there (e.g. Microbiology, Organic Chemistry, Plant Science, Genetics, Viticulture, etc.).
I also like the broad scope and specialized topics that my school can offer, which include interesting studies like Wine-making, Wine-tasting, French language, etc.
Besides, our curriculum follows a serious engineering training principle - just to name a few: Calculus, Physics, Mechanical Fundamentals, Enzyme Engineering - it's really surprising to realize that I learned quite a lot in retrospect.

The degree looks very good under standard public opinions: lots of career-oriented courses, most of them very interesting, and excellent employment prospects.
So there is really nothing to complain about my undergraduate study - at least I spent 4 wonderful and fulfilling years.
But, *why didn't I choose wine related career after graduate?*

> The best thing to combat fear, despair, and fatalism is knowledge.

Well, people with proper professional training about wine-making know the following facts:
-   The quality of wine mostly depends on the quality of grapes, which further depends on many parameters that cannot be changed: the breed, geographic location, the climate of that year, etc.
-   The other major factor that can determine wine quality is how those grapes are made into wine: only master winemakers know the secret of preserving the best flavors.
-   The price of wine is not completely determined by its quality: only the smartest merchants know the secret of marketing.

This kind of fact that "some grapes are born to be great" or "some wine is made to be great" sounds very depressing to me.
In the end, I decided to change my career direction and focus on the pursuit of knowledge, in the hope of that the chance of achieving a more meaningful life is better - of course, with personal creativeness and efforts.

<div class="foot_notes">
P.S. I am actually not so radical all the way through: an accident in the last year of my high school almost ruined my family, which brought me many years of special experience - those years hardened my mind.
Whenever something is beyond remedy, I do not regret to drop it and do not hesitate to make another thing work better.
