Oenology is the science and study of wine and winemaking (actually we study how to make all types of alcoholic drinks) - this was what I chose for my undergraduate study.
[College of Oenology at Northwest A&F University](http://wine.nwsuaf.edu.cn/) is no doubt the best choice of this study in China - this was where I spent 4 memorable years.

I like practical and experimental studies, so I enjoyed learning many courses through experiments about nature there (e.g. Microbiology, Organic Chemistry, Plant Science, Genetics, Viticulture, etc.)
I also like the broad scope and many specialized topics that my school can offer, which include interesting studies like Wine-making, Wine-tasting, French language, etc.

Besides, our curriculum follows a serious engineering training principle - just to name a few: Calculus, Physics, Mechanical Fundamentals, Enzyme Engineering - it's really amazing to realize that I actually learned quite a lot in retrospect.
So there is really nothing to complain about my undergraduate study - at least I spent 4 wonderful and fulfilling years.

But, why didn't I choose wine related career after graduate?

Well, people with proper professional training about wine-making know the following facts:
-   The quality of wine mostly depends on the quality of grapes, which further depends on many factors that cannot be changed: the breed of grape, geographic location, the climate of that year, etc.
-   The other major factor that can affect quality in wine is how those grapes are made into wine: only master winemakers know the secret of preserving the best flavors of the grapes.

This kind of fact that "some grapes are born to be great" or "some wine is made to be great" sounds very pessimistic to me.
So I decided to change my career direction, in which the chance of achieving a more meaningful life is better - of course with personal creativeness and efforts.
