# Why didn't I choose wine related career?

[Oenology is the science and study of wine and wine-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenology) (actually we study how to make all types of alcoholic drinks) - this was what I chose for my undergraduate study.
[College of Oenology at Northwest A&F University](http://wine.nwsuaf.edu.cn/) is no doubt the best choice of this study in China - this was where I spent four memorable years.

## My college rocks
I like practical and experimental studies, so I enjoyed learning courses through experiments about nature there (e.g., Microbiology, Organic Chemistry, Plant Science, Genetics, Viticulture, etc.).
I also like the broad scope and specialized topics that my school can offer, which include fancy subjects like Wine-making, Wine-tasting, French language, etc.
Besides, our curriculum follows a rigorous engineering training principle.
<!-- just to name a few: Calculus, Physics, Mechanical Fundamentals, Enzyme Engineering - it's really surprising to realize that I learned quite a lot in retrospect. -->

The degree appears very good under standard evaluations: lots of career-oriented courses, most of them very interesting, and excellent employment prospects.
So there is nothing to complain - at least I spent four wonderful and fulfilling years.
But, *why didn't I choose wine related career after graduate?*

> The best thing to combat fear, despair, and fatalism is knowledge.

Well, people with proper professional training about wine-making know the following facts:
-   The quality of wine mostly depends on the quality of grapes, which further depends on many *unchangeable parameters*: the breed, geographic location, the climate of that year, etc.
-   The other major factor that can determine wine quality is how those grapes are *treated*: only master winemakers know the secret of preserving [primary aromas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroma_of_wine), while fake masters use [essential oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil).
-   The price of wine is not a real image its *value*: only the smartest merchants know the secret of marketing.

This kind of fact that *"some grapes are born to be great"* or *"some wine is made to be great"* sounds very depressing to me.
In the end, I decided to change my career direction and only focus on the knowledge itself, in the hope of that the chance of achieving a more meaningful life is better - of course, with personal creativeness and efforts.
