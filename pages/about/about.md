I am Xiaokun Wu, aka Kelvin, and my Chinese name is \[吴晓堃\].
I am curious about anything that is unknown to me, and would always like to try new things.
I am keen on making things from imagination into reality, and on making prototypes towards perfection.

## Work Experience
Currently I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Centre for the Analysis of Motion, Entertainment Research and Applications (CAMERA)](https://www.camera.ac.uk/) group of [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).

### Programming
I owned my first personal computer (with [Pentium II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_II)) in 1998 and started fighting bugs since then.
Now many technologies seem not hot anymore, but I learn new skills faster than time changes.

## Education
I [received my PhD](/pages/about/phd-defended) in Computer Science from [Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-graphics/) and [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), where I closely collaborated with Prof. [Hans-Peter Seidel](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~hpseidel/), [Michael Wand](http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/wandm/) and [Klaus Hildebrandt](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/~klaus/) on Computer Graphics related research projects.
Before that, I received my Master degree in Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), under the supervision of Prof. [Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/).

To tell you how diverse my interests is: I received my Bachelor degree in Engineering from [College of Oenology at Northwest A&F University](http://wine.nwsuaf.edu.cn/), but in the end I decided to [change my career direction](/pages/about/why-not-wine).

## Sports
Besides research, sports is the most important focus in my life. I used to play basketball quite a lot but stopped doing it after a severe injury.
I cannot walk as normal for nearly one year, then I learned Latin American dances and Yoga later for better recovery.
I also kept the habit of going to the gym daily since 2010, mainly focused on weightlifting training.

### Workout
My training is more like scientific experiments: study human body biology, make rigorous training schedules and evaluate performance, calculate accurate nutrients balance, etc.
Well, people who treat sports seriously should have been through very similar practices.

The good news is that I know how to survey and conduct experiments due to years of scientific training - this is one of my favorite example to show that scientific study can help in solving daily life tasks.
I am also very interested in applying my professional knowledge to perform [technical analysis](/pages/about/clean_openpose.mp4) in my spare time.

## Life and Misc.
I am a classical music fan - tried to learn violin and piano, but no time to practice.
When the weather is good, I do outdoor photography and post-processing if it's memorable.

### Travel
I very like reading history and am very lucky to stay in European countries in recent years, so I can easily visit historical sites to feel different culture to my own root.

I also very like keeping close to nature, so I organized several hiking & camping trips in the past.
In one of my [craziest journey](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PY-qpkwEc0V5hBueDGillzdWZcw&usp=sharing), I completed [3 most famous hiking route in Norway](/pages/about/norway_rocks.jpg), took a [kayak & glacier trekking](/pages/about/glacier_kayak.jpg) trip, and drove nearly 5000 KM in 9 days (among other activities) - You see? I am a good planner and energetic :smile:.

### Languages and Reading
I am a native Chinese speaker and the tone of my hometown ([Baoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baoding)) is almost the same as standard Chinese. I am fluency in English and hold a good number of German vocabulary for daily use.
I learned Spanish and French grammar in different stages, and I would very like to keep learning in spare time.

### Play Bridge
I am a member of the [World Bridge Federation](http://www.worldbridge.org/) and used to play regularly before graduate.
As the team leader, I competed for the [11th World Youth Team Championships (Bangkok 2006)](http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person/?x?qryid=24297), representing schools team of China.
