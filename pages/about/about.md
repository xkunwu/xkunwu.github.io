I am WU Xiaokun, aka Kelvin, and my Chinese name is 吴晓堃.

I received my PhD in *Computer Science* and my Master degree in *Mathematics*.
I also know a little more than necessary about wine.

When I feel too tired to read books or write codes, I do sports.
I do carefully studied workouts so I can travel around and search for natural beauty.
If you happen to meet me somewhere, I would like to learn your language and story.

<!-- I am curious about anything that is unknown to me, and would always like to [try new challenges](/pages/about/fear_nothing).
I am keen on making things from imagination into reality, and on making prototypes towards perfection. -->

<!-- ## Work Experience
I was a _post-doctoral researcher_ at the [Centre for the Analysis of Motion, Entertainment Research and Applications (CAMERA)](https://www.camera.ac.uk/) group of [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/), from Mar 2017 to Dec 2018. -->

<!-- ### Programming
I owned my first personal computer (with [Pentium II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_II)) in 1998.
Nonetheless, I learn new skills faster than quick changes in technology. -->

<!-- ## Education

I [received my PhD](/pages/about/phd-defended) in _Computer Science_ from [Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-graphics/) and [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), where I closely collaborated with Prof. [Hans-Peter Seidel](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~hpseidel/), [Michael Wand](http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/wandm/) and [Klaus Hildebrandt](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/~klaus/) on _Computer Graphics_ related topics.

Before that, I received my Master degree in _Mathematics_ from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) on _Computer Graphics and Computer Aided Geometric Design (CG&CAGD)_, under the supervision of Prof. [Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/). -->

<!-- To tell you how diverse my interests is: I received my Bachelor degree in _Engineering_ from [College of Oenology at Northwest A&F University](http://wine.nwsuaf.edu.cn/), but in the end I decided to [change my career direction](/pages/about/why-not-wine). -->

<!-- ## Sports
Besides research, sports is the most significant part of my life.
I used to play basketball quite a lot, but stopped doing it after a severe injury.
I cannot walk as normal for nearly one year, then I learned Latin American dances and Yoga later for better recovery.
I kept the habit of _going to the gym daily_ since 2010, mainly focused on weightlifting techniques. -->

<!-- ### Workout
My training is more like _scientific experiments_: study human body biology, calculate nutrients balance, make training plans, evaluate performance, etc. -->

<!-- People who treat sports seriously should have been through similar practices. -->
<!-- - this is one of my favorite examples to show that scientific study can help in solving daily life tasks :smile:. -->
<!-- I am good at conducting surveys and experiments due to years of _research training_.
I am also interested in applying my expertise to [performance analysis](/pages/about/clean_openpose.mp4). -->

<!-- ## Life and Misc. -->
<!-- I am a classical music fan - tried to learn violin and piano, but no time to practice. -->

<!-- ### Travel
I like reading history and visiting historical sites to explore cultural differences.
I do _outdoor photography_ and post-processing if it's memorable.

I like keeping close to nature and organized several _hiking & camping_ trips.
In one of my [crazy but well-planned journeys](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PY-qpkwEc0V5hBueDGillzdWZcw&usp=sharing): I drove nearly 5000 KM in 9 days, finished [three most famous hiking routes in Norway](/pages/about/norway_rocks.jpg), took a [kayak & glacier trekking trip](/pages/about/glacier_kayak.jpg), and did many other activities. -->

<!-- ### Languages and Reading
I am a native Chinese :cn: speaker.
and the tone of my hometown ([Baoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baoding)) is almost the same as standard Chinese.
I am fluency in English :uk: and my German :de: vocabulary is large enough for daily readings.
I learned Spanish :es: and French :fr: grammar in different stages - would like to keep learning. -->

<!-- ### Play Bridge
I am a member of the [World Bridge Federation](http://www.worldbridge.org/) and was in charge of the school's team of my university.
As the team leader, I competed for the [11th World Youth Team Championships (Bangkok 2006)](http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person/?x?qryid=24297), representing schools team of China. -->
