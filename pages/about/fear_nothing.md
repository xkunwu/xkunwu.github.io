## Overcome [Aquaphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaphobia)
When I was about 5, my parents took me to the sea for the first time.
My parents and their friends were young and impulsive at that age, so they attempted to swim towards blue water, and they carried me in a life jacket with them.
When I saw the moored buoy is drawing near to me, which is larger than my head, I collapsed.
After that experience, I cannot even hold my panic in the swimming pool, especially when I am not able to touch the bottom.

Then it was 2010, I joined the department retreat of snorkeling in the red sea, when I was visiting [KAUST](https://vcc.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx).
Without a doubt, I cannot swim at the time.
I held the stern rail beside the diving platform, looking at the corals tinted with emerald green, hesitating.
But I was young and impulsive at that age, so I just jumped into the sea, not even checked my goggles.

After a short moment of struggling, I was surprised to find that:
I can somehow float near the surface - probably due to the red sea is more salty than typical.
