# Fear nothing
> Work hard, live hard, and do something more challenging than imaginable.

Excerpted from a long letter.

Life's a journey, and I'd like to explore new trails.

I have no blood of adventure by nature: I saw too much weakness inside, stayed in my little comfort zone, and doubted about everything risky.
But the fate threw me out violently - not knowing the answers to life, and nobody can help me at that moment - I was 17.
I was pushed onto the journey without any preparation: there is no other choice but go ahead and overcome anyway.

When I was about 5, my parents took me to the sea for the first time.
My parents and their friends were young and impulsive at that age, so they attempted to swim towards blue water, and they carried me in a life jacket with them.
When I saw the moored buoy is drawing near to me, which is larger than my head, I collapsed.
After that experience, I cannot even hold my panic in the swimming pool, especially when I am not able to touch the bottom.

Then it was 2010, I joined the department retreat of snorkeling in the red sea, when I was visiting [KAUST](https://vcc.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx).
Without a doubt, I cannot swim at the time.
I held the stern rail beside the diving platform, looking at the corals tinted with emerald green, hesitating.
But I was young and impulsive at that age, so I just jumped into the sea, not even checked my goggles.

After a short moment of struggling, I was surprised to find that:
I can somehow float near the surface - probably due to the red sea is more salty than typical.
It was amazing being in the sea and enjoying it for the first time - I found an entirely new world.

After that, I fear of water no more - I can still not swim elegantly, but I can somehow float near the surface - even in the pool.

## Overcome [Roller coaster phobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_phobia)
At the age of 30, I visit [Europa-Park](https://www.europapark.de/en/park/attractions-rollercoaster-junkies?attraction-category[]=87) for the first time.
It's not because I did not like fun when I was a teenager - I had a fear of roller-coasters.

When I was about 8, my brother took me to a small park near my home.
After some boring sightseeing, he decided to try a simple roller-coaster for the first time - along with me.
The cabin can hold two people in a row: he let me _sit on the front seat_ and thus he can keep me in sight.
I have no idea what was going to happen, but I still remember that sight around a U-turn _now_.

My mind was brought back by the safety staff.

### Sit down and behold the abyss
I took a short rest on the cliff, sit down with my feet hanging freely in the air, and behold the deep abyss.
What did I see at that moment?
I see my heart is deeper than the ground - not a slight amount of fear is in sight.

### The Trial of the Troll
A heavy fog rose.
I felt a bit lost: I kept my head down, watch out for pitfalls, and follow the trail of precursors.

## Overcome [Thalassophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia)

I went to the red sea again, but on the other side this time.

### Look up from -30m
I held my breath and turned my body upwards, so I can see the bright surface.
That sight was miracle looking.
The surface is so much brighter, just like the heaven above our head.
The surface looks so much closer: I stretched out my arm, and it seems the surface is just at the tip of my finger.

### Be in the dark
Most of the "sea-foods" live in completely dark, quietly, and probably won't draw anyone's attention forever.

## Know when to take the brake
All my friends know I drive fast, but they are still willing to travel with me.
