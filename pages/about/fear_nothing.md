# Fear nothing, and move on
> Work hard, live hard, and do something more challenging than imaginable.

Life's a journey, and I'd like to explore new trails.

I have no blood of adventure by nature: I saw too much weakness inside, stayed in my little comfort zone, and doubted about everything risky.
But the fate threw me out violently: not knowing the answers to life, and nobody can help me at that time - I was 17.
I was pushed onto the track without any preparation: _there is no other choice but go ahead and overcome anyway._

## Go to the sea - overcome [Aquaphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaphobia)

When I was about 5, my parents brought me to the sea for the first time.
My parents and their friends were young and impulsive at that age, so they attempted to swim towards blue water, and they carried me in a life jacket.
When I saw the moored buoy is drawing near to me, which is larger than my head, I collapsed.
After that experience, I cannot even contain my panic in the swimming pool, especially when I am not able to feel the ground.

Then it was 2010, I joined the department retreat of snorkeling in the red sea, when I was visiting [KAUST](https://vcc.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx).
Without a doubt, I cannot swim.
I held the stern-rail quietly, looking at the corals tinted with emerald green, hesitating.
_But I was young and impulsive at that age, so I just jumped into the sea_, not even checked my goggles.

After a short moment of struggling, I was surprised to find that:
I can somehow float near the surface - probably due to the red sea is more salty than typical.
It was amazing to be in the sea and enjoy it for the first time - I found an entirely new world.

After that, I fear of water no more.
I can still not swim elegantly, but I can somehow float near the surface - even in the pool.

## Go to the park - overcome [Roller coaster phobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_phobia)
At the age of 30, I visit [Europa-Park](https://www.europapark.de/en/park/attractions-rollercoaster-junkies?attraction-category[]=87) for the first time.
It's not because I did not like fun when I was younger - I had a fear of coasters.
But the only purpose of this trip is challenging myself.

When I was about 8, my brother took me to a small park near my home.
After some boring sightseeing, he decided to try a coaster for the first time - along with me.
The cabin can hold two people in a row: he let me _sit on the front seat_ and thus he can keep me in sight.
I had no idea what was going to happen, but I still remember that sight around a U-turn _now_.

My thoughts were interrupted by the staff - he helped me to perform the final safety check.
I took a deep breath and held the handrail firmly.
Suddenly, the coaster dashed into the sky on a short beep.
I probably made some screaming at turning points, but to my surprise, overall the thrilling experience was quite enjoyable.

After returned to the ground, I realized: my fear was merely a derivative of limited cognition.
_It can take some time to grow stronger, so allow the mental power to develop._

My fervor completely ignited: I took almost every roaster before the park closed.
I took the ["Silver Star"](https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/silver-star) at last (the cart was raised to the top slowly before an almost straight dive):
the maximal amount of tension was created at the top, but I liked that feeling of sudden release.
Since then, I am fond of going to high places.

### Sit down and behold the abyss
4 PM: We arrived at the car park of Kjeragbolten.
It's overcast and windy.
I am getting worried about weather change - there's snow everywhere on the road, and it's getting dark - so I keep encouraging my buddies to hurry up.

The muddy trail towards the rock stretches out on the snow, but luckily, no ice on the rock, and no other people on site.
My buddies are looking at each other, so I ask them to take photos.

The rock is much larger than I thought.
I jump onto it, make sure my buddies are taking shots, and start to pose.
But their photos are not fancy-looking, so I jump onto the rock again, and again.

Now I had enough fun.
I take a short rest on the cliff, sit down, hang my feet freely in the air, and behold the deep abyss.

What am I looking?
I am looking at myself; _I am looking deep into my mind - much deeper than the 1000m abyss, not a slight amount of fear is in sight._

### The Trial of the Troll
Trolltunga means "Troll's tongue" - the route to that tongue is not for the weak.

The camping site came alive early in the morning.
I joined the Nordic walk flock and started 3 hours rushing.

The first rise was slippery stone steps: steep uphill, nearly deserted and full of mud.
Then the second rise was covered with moss and snow, among patches of icy ponds.
The trip was enjoyable at this stage: waterfalls running down snow-bergs in the background, then dropping into the calm lakes.

It's getting hard on the third rise: the main trail was full of thick mud, which can easily swallow people's shoes, while side tracks were on icy moss and snow.
The last 3km was a nightmare: roads are not very distinguishable on the marsh, while many slopes are completely under ice.

The weather also became worse: icy rain kept dropping on my head.
Then suddenly, a thick fog arose.
I felt a bit lost: only 10m's visibility around me.
_However, I expelled thoughts away from my mind, kept my head down to watch out for pitfalls, and followed the trail of precursors._

When I finally arrived at the viewing platform, the fog quickly vanished.
I sat down on the tip of the tongue, enjoying the pleasant sunshine after the rain stopped.

## Dive into the sea - overcome [Thalassophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia)

I revisited the red sea 6-years later, but this time on the other side.

When my diving coach asked if I have the problem of Thalassophobia, this photo immediately popped into my mind:

> [Deep sea photo (Warning: make sure you do not have Thalassophobia before click!)](/pages/about/media/deep_sea.jpg) - Image from [this **horrible** source](http://www.divingstory.com/2017/05/27/%E6%83%B3%E6%BD%9C%E6%B0%B4%E6%97%85%E6%B8%B8%E7%9A%84-%E5%85%88%E8%AF%8A%E6%96%AD%E4%BD%A0%E6%9C%89%E6%81%90%E6%B5%B7%E7%97%87%E5%90%97%EF%BC%9F/).

Somehow I had a strange fear of enormously large things in the deep sea, since like forever.
But I told him firmly with a smile: No.

### Look up from -30m
I was a little upset to know that [Deep Diver](https://www.padi.com/courses/deep-diver) was the first advanced course on my schedule.
Anyway, I bit the bullet and followed my couch quickly down to -30m along a steep seabed.

We stopped at a flat area - utter darkness surrounded us.
I got a little nervous, daring not look at anywhere else than my coach's instructions.

He indicated me to notice that the color of light from above is dark blue, then I held my breath and turned my face upwards.
That sight was like a miracle.

The sea surface is so bright and feels so close to me, just like heaven above our head.
_I stretched out my arm, and it seems at the tip of my finger, expelling the darkness surrounding me._

Since then, I started to believe that light can guide me through the shadow of fear.
But what if there is no light above my head?

### Be into the dark
_Most of the sea-creature live in totally dark, quietly, and probably won't draw anyone's attention forever._
So [Night Diver](https://www.padi.com/courses/night-diver) is an excellent opportunity to visit them.

Before we jumped into the water, my coach assigned me a very odd instruction: I must turn off my torch on his signal.
What could that possibly mean?

In the first few minutes, I am getting used to the darkness.
There are [urchins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin) and [lionfishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterois) everywhere - they sleep at home during the day.

After having some fun chasing a big sea turtle, my coach stopped me.
He waved me to turn off my torch - he did that too - then we suddenly fell into complete darkness, except maybe a few sparkling starlights.

Baffled and tried to detect anything unusual, I suddenly saw streamlines shining with blue sparkles is approaching me!
When I also felt a rush of torrent towards my face, I quickly dodged aside and waved my arms like crazy.
Then, I noticed blue sparkles appearing wherever my arms strike - just like that magic ["lit up sea"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrL1kfxawuI) in _Life of Pi_:

"Feel like another dive in the night?" My coach asked me after we returned to the boat.

"Yes, for sure," I said. "But I would like to wear a jellyfish-proof mask next time."

## Know when to take the brake
All my friends know I drive fast, but they are still willing to travel with me.

Each car has own limit, so I never try to overstretch them.
Last time I felt the car is starting to lose stability, I released the gas pedal a little bit without any hesitation - the speed gently dropping to 240km/h.
I never stare at the speed meter while driving: I look at the road into the distance, I watch out for possible nearby danger, and I keep an eye on every indicator on the panel.

_Speed is never the center of my concern: I know the focus should always place on my destination._
Using the brake certainly reduces my speed; but without taking any break, I might never arrive at my target.
Besides, I do not want to miss too much of the scenery during my journey.
