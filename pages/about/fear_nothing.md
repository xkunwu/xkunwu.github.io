# Fear nothing
> Work hard, live hard, and do something more challenging than imaginable.

Life's a journey, and I'd like to explore new trails.

I have no blood of adventure by nature: I saw too much weakness inside, stayed in my little comfort zone, and doubted about everything risky.
But the fate threw me out violently - not knowing the answers to life, and nobody can help me at that moment - I was 17.
I was pushed onto the journey without any preparation: there is no other choice but go ahead and overcome anyway.

When I was about 5, my parents took me to the sea for the first time.
My parents and their friends were young and impulsive at that age, so they attempted to swim towards blue water, and they carried me in a life jacket with them.
When I saw the moored buoy is drawing near to me, which is larger than my head, I collapsed.
After that experience, I cannot even hold my panic in the swimming pool, especially when I am not able to touch the bottom.

Then it was 2010, I joined the department retreat of snorkeling in the red sea, when I was visiting [KAUST](https://vcc.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx).
Without a doubt, I cannot swim at the time.
I held the stern rail beside the diving platform, looking at the corals tinted with emerald green, hesitating.
But I was young and impulsive at that age, so I just jumped into the sea, not even checked my goggles.

After a short moment of struggling, I was surprised to find that:
I can somehow float near the surface - probably due to the red sea is more salty than typical.
It was amazing being in the sea and enjoying it for the first time - I found an entirely new world.

After that, I fear of water no more - I can still not swim elegantly, but I can somehow float near the surface - even in the pool.

## Go to the park - overcome [Roller coaster phobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_phobia)
At the age of 30, I visit [Europa-Park](https://www.europapark.de/en/park/attractions-rollercoaster-junkies?attraction-category[]=87) for the first time.
It's not because I did not like fun when I was younger - I had a fear of coasters.
But the only purpose of this trip, is to challenge myself.

When I was about 8, my brother took me to a small park near my home.
After some boring sightseeing, he decided to try a coaster for the first time - along with me.
The cabin can hold two people in a row: he let me _sit on the front seat_ and thus he can keep me in sight.
I have no idea what was going to happen, but I still remember that sight around a U-turn _now_.

My thought was interrupted by the staff - he helped me to perform the final safety check.
I took a deep breath and held the handrail firmly.
Suddenly, the coaster dashed into the sky on a short beep.
I probably made some screaming at turning points, but to my surprise, overall the thrilling experience was quite enjoyable.

After returned to the ground, I realized: my fear was merely a derivative of limited cognition.
It can take some time to grow stronger, so allow the mental power to develop.

My passion completely ignited: I took almost every roaster before the park closed.
I took the ["Silver Star"](https://www.europapark.de/en/attractions/silver-star) at last (the cart was raised to the top slowly before an almost straight dive):
the maximal amount of tension is created at the top, but I like the feeling of sudden release.
Since then, I am fond of going to high places.

### Sit down and behold the abyss
4 PM: I arrived at the car park of Kjeragbolten.
It's overcast and windy.
I am worried about weather change - there's snow everywhere on the road, and it's getting dark - so I urged my buddies to hurry up.

The muddy trail towards the rock is on the snow, but luckily, no ice on the rock, and no other people on site.
My buddies are looking at each other, so I ask them to take photos.
The rock is much larger than I thought.
I jump onto it, make sure my buddies are taking shots, and start to pose.
But their photos are not fancy-looking, so I jump onto the rock again, and again.

Now I had enough fun.
I take a short rest on the cliff, sit down, hang my feet freely in the air, and behold the deep abyss.
What am I looking?
I am looking at myself; I am looking at my mind - farther than the ground, not a slight amount of fear is in sight.

### The Trial of the Troll
Trolltunga literally means "Troll tongue", and the route to reach that tongue is not for the weak.

A heavy fog rose.
I felt a bit lost: I kept my head down, watch out for pitfalls, and follow the trail of precursors.

## Dive into the sea - overcome [Thalassophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia)

I went to the red sea again, but on the other side this time.

### Look up from -30m
I held my breath and turned my body upwards, so I can see the bright surface.
That sight was miracle looking.
The surface is so much brighter, just like the heaven above our head.
The surface looks so much closer: I stretched out my arm, and it seems the surface is just at the tip of my finger.

### Be in the dark
Most of the "sea-foods" live in completely dark, quietly, and probably won't draw anyone's attention forever.

## Know when to take the brake
All my friends know I drive fast, but they are still willing to travel with me.

<!-- ## Look, boy, fear nothing and keep moving. -->
