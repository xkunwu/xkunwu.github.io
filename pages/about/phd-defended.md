Dr. Qianru Sun (right 1) reported my talk.
Bertram Somieski was the awesome photographer.

## My Doctoral Hat
The tradition of MPI is every doctoral student will receive a specially tailored hat as a souvenir after defense talk.
The hat is usually made by colleagues and friends: items on this hat are memorials that mark interesting or "stupid" things that student has done.

#### _所长_
This name tag in Chinese means _Head of the Institute_, but it really means _Guard of the Institute_ by my little buddies.
I got this nickname in the first year at MPI, since I rarely stay at home and sometimes even stay in the office overnight.
My office used to be at one corner of the building, which looks rather like a lighthouse in the night :grin:.

#### Ticket on the Tassel
If I do not tell, you might think that paper on the tassel is my certificate - I also thought the same at first.
Now the truth: it's a speeding ticket - of course, a fake one.
That's because they all know I drive fast - admitted, I usually drive over 200km/h - but _who does not drive fast in **Germany**?_ :joy:
Anyway, thank you guys for your advice.

Many thanks to everyone that made this day even more special to me - it's one of the most memorable days of my life.
