Acknowledgment: Prof. Dr. Philipp Slusallek (left 1) chaired the committee of my defense talk (Promotionskolloquium).
Prof. Dr. Hans-Peter Seidel (left 2), Michael Wand (right 3) and Klaus Hildebrandt (right 2) are in the committee.
Dr. Qianru Sun (right 1) reported my talk.

## My Doctoral Hat
The tradition of MPI is every doctoral student will received a special tailored hat as souvenir after defense talk.
The hat is usually made by colleagues and friends, and the items on the hat are memorials that record interesting or "stupid" things that student has done.

#### "所长"
This name tag with Chinese Characters literally means "Head of the Institute", but actually means "Guard of the Institute" by my little buddies.
I got this nickname on the first year at MPI, since I rarely stay at home and sometimes even stay in the office overnight.
My office used to be at one corner of the building, which looks rather like a lighthouse in the night :grin:.

#### Ticket on the Tassel
If I do not introduce, you might think that paper on the tassel is my certificate - actually I also thought like at first.
Now the truth: it's a speeding ticket - of course, a fake one.
That's because they all know I drive fast - admitted, I constantly drive over 200km/h - but _who does not drive fast in GERMANY?_ :joy:
Besides, I would argue that I never go up to 250km/h - you know, mainly because never had a chance of driving a super car.

Anyway, it's really one of most memorable days in my life.
