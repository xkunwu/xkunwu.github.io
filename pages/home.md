I am a curious and vigorous researcher.
When I feel too tired to read books or write codes, I do sports.

Currently I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Centre for the Analysis of Motion, Entertainment Research and Applications (CAMERA)](https://www.camera.ac.uk/) group of [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).

<span style="color:red">I'm open to new opportunities.</span>

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-graphics/) and [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html).
I also hold a Master degree in Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).
