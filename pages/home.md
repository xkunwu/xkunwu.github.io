I am a curious and vigorous researcher.
When I feel too tired to read books or write codes, I do sports.

I'm open to new opportunities.
{: .notice--danger}

I received my PhD in *Computer Science* from [Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-graphics/) and [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html).
I also hold a Master degree in *Mathematics* from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).
